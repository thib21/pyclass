## Iteration with Pandas

You have two options to open the `pandas_iterate.ipynb` file (in the `notebooks/` folder):

- with Jupyter Lab: open a terminal and enter the following commands:

  ```bash
  conda activate pyclass
  jupyter lab
  ```

- with Visual Studio Code: open the notebook as a regular file. If asked, specify you need to use the `pyclass` environment.
